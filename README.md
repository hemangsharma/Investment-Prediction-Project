## Features

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Fetch historical and live data for stocks, ETFs, commodities, and currencies using APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).
   - Scrape financial news and social media sentiment for market analysis.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Handle missing values, normalize data, and generate technical indicators like RSI, SMA, and MACD.
   - Engineer features to enhance prediction accuracy.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Use time-series models like ARIMA, LSTM, and Transformer-based architectures for price predictions.
   - Leverage machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost for trend classification.

4. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Perform sentiment analysis using NLP models (e.g., BERT).
   - Optimize portfolios with risk-return tradeoff metrics like Sharpe Ratio.

5. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Interactive dashboards for trend visualization.
   - Comparative analysis of multiple assets with key investment metrics.

## Architecture

### Data Pipeline
1. **Raw Data Ingestion**:
   - Fetch data from APIs or web scraping.
   - Store in cloud-based data warehouses (e.g., AWS S3, GCP BigQuery).

2. **Processing**:
   - Preprocess data using Pandas and NumPy.
   - Normalize, clean, and augment datasets.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Build and train predictive models using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy models as REST APIs using Flask or FastAPI.
   - Host dashboards on Streamlit or Plotly Dash.
